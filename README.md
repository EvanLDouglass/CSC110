This is a repository for the Python programs I wrote when I was initially learning the language in my first computer science class, 
and in general for other short or simple programs. Because there are many small files, I have grouped them into folders based on 
their general function, such as text processing or mathematical calculations. I've also included a folder for some of the very first 
programs I wrote.
