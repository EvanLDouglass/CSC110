# Starter Programs

Included in this repository are programs I wrote when initially learning Python. Many are from the book "Starting Out with Python"
by Tony Gaddis. Others are short exercises from my first computer science class at North Seattle College, CSC110. 

These programs are short and simple, so the explanation comment at the start of each file should be enough to grasp the purpose.
